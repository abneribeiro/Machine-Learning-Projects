# **Machine Learning Projects**

This repository contains a collection of simple machine learning projects. Each project is contained in its own folder, which includes the necessary code and data files. The projects are designed to be easy to understand and run, and are suitable for beginners who are learning machine learning.

### **Project List**
The following is a list of the projects included in this repository:

- **Project 1: Classification using Logistic Regression**

  - Description: This project explores classification using logistic regression. The goal is to predict whether a bank loan will be approved or not, based on various features of the loan application.
Technologies used: Python, Scikit-learn
Folder location: `./project1_europe_bikes`

To run any of the projects in this repository, you will need to have the necessary dependencies installed. The projects were developed using Python 3, and require the following libraries:


- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
  
To install these libraries, you can use the following command:


```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn 
```
Once you have the dependencies installed, you can navigate to the folder of the project you want to run and execute the main Python file. For example, to run Project 1, you would use the following commands:

```bash
cd ./project1_europe_bikes pd.ipynb
```

This will execute the main Python file for the project, which will load the data, train the machine learning model, and output the results.
